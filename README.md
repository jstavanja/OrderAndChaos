Tic-tac-toe-like game based on an 80's board game. Made in Java (with JavaFX).

## Basic game rules
The game is unique in that both players, called Order and Chaos, control both Xs and Os. Order, going first, aims to get five like pieces in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) on the 6Ã—6 board, while Chaos aims to fill the board without completion of a line of five like pieces. If Order creates a line of six pieces, this is not counted as win.
